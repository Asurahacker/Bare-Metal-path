# PROJECT NAME: SEQUENCED LEDS
## GOAL: 
1. To simply turn on LEDs in a sequence.
2. To know how to set a group of bits in a register to OUTPUT
3. To know how to use "0b" keyword to define binary values
4. To learn to use "for" keyword to iterate in C

## UNDERSTANDING:
To get an understanding of bitwise logic, refer back to Project 1 (01_ignite).
Have a copy of the Arduino nano pinout to know the ports you are dealing with
